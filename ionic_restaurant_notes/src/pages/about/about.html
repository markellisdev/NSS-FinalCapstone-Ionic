      I grew up interested in music and computers. As a child I loved playing Carmen Sandiego on my Apple IIe and at 12 years old, was able to take a University course on BASIC programming. Although I loved computers, music took precedence and I began playing in bands as a teen. I continued that path through college and switched to the production side of concerts and events after college. I have been fortunate to work with many national acts as well as being a part of the highest grossing tour in North America, 2002, Tina Turner’s Twenty Four Seven. I have worked as carpenter, electrician, lighting crew chief, camera operator, led technician, video crew chief and video director.

      Fast forward to 2016 and I’m now father to an awesome 6 year old boy. After nearly 25 years in event production, I decided to look for a second career, one that would allow me to spend more time at home yet still challenge me to learn and grow and have room to advance. I’ve always maintained my own computers, those of my family and sometimes tour-mates, installing RAM, hard drives and software, so it just seemed logical to follow my love of computers and technology, which allowed me to use the skills I’d honed in production; managing and working as a part of small teams, having to constantly learn new technology and skills, and adjusting daily to the constraints and requests of clients. While learning and applying knowledge gained at NSS, I know I made the right choice.
